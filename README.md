Step 1: Creating a mock datababase data in excel sheets and insert them in our mongoDB using the python file named "DBInsertion.ipynb"
Step 2: Linking our API to the DB
The functionalities in the API are the following:
- Login
- Sign up
- Search for a specific movie
- Get the whole movies list
- Add rating
- Update rating
Step 3: Developing the frontend and linking it to the API
The functionalities in Angular are the following:
- Login
- Sign up
- Table for movies getting the values but there is a delay in refreshing
- Serach not linked to the API.

Note: The IP of the API should be changed in Angular in sharedservice.service.ts

RUNNING the APP:
- Open MongoDB and connect to the localhost:27017
- Download the DB file and run the DBInsertion.ipynb to populate the DB
- Open the API.py file and run the python code
- Open Webstorm and run the project
